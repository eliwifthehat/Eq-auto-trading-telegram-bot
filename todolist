[ ] Install required libraries:
python-telegram-bot (Telegram integration)
web3.py (ETH, Base, BNB)
solana-py (Solana)
ccxt (optional, for CEX integration)
ta or ta-lib (technical analysis)

Tips for Staying Free & Robust
Use public RPC endpoints, but be aware of rate limits and reliability (upgrade to paid as you scale).
Use SQLite or free cloud DBs for storage.
Keep your code modular for easy upgrades.
Start with paper trading to build trust and avoid regulatory issues.
